1 thread
Thread 0 of 1 is BEFORE the barrier.
Thread 0 of 1 is AFTER the barrier.

2 threads
Thread 1 of 2 is BEFORE the barrier.
Thread 1 of 2 is AFTER the barrier.
Thread 0 of 2 is BEFORE the barrier.

<<< with pragma omp parallel >>>

2 threads
Thread 0 of 2 is BEFORE the barrier.
Thread 1 of 2 is BEFORE the barrier.
Thread 0 of 2 is AFTER the barrier.
Thread 1 of 2 is AFTER the barrier.

note: when using pragma omp parallel every thread will print the "BEFORE" statement first
      and the "AFTER" statement just how it should be. BEFORE comes before..
